## 🤔 Who Am I?

"Hey there! I’m Yushika Jhundoo – a cybersecurity buff by day and an aspiring chef by night! When I'm not cracking codes or tackling cyber challenges, you’ll find me whipping up something tasty in the kitchen. Cooking's my creative playground, where I love blending flavors and dreaming up one-of-a-kind dishes. Let’s connect !

In my free time, I love staying active and embracing the outdoors. Whether hiking along scenic trails or jogging to clear my mind, staying active is essential for me. When I'm not working out, playing the piano, or immersed in cybersecurity, I enjoy unwinding with friends—especially after long hours in front of a screen. I’m passionate about playing and watching sports, particularly football and soccer.

My motivation comes from my parents, who made countless sacrifices to provide me with a better life. Their resilience inspires me to pursue my goals relentlessly, especially in the ever-evolving world of technology. I’m constantly seeking new knowledge and skills to stay ahead in the rapidly changing landscape of cybersecurity.

With a foundation in IT management, web development, business operations, and healthcare, I’ve developed a deep understanding of how technology drives business. These experiences laid the groundwork for my transition into cybersecurity, where I now focus on vulnerability management, incident response, and ethical hacking.
