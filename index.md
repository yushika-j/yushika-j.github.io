## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me
I'm Yushika Jhundoo, currently a fourth-year Computer Science student with a focus on networking, cybersecurity, and protocol analysis. My diverse background in customer service, IT support, and web development has allowed me to build a solid foundation in problem-solving and technical skills. I'm deeply passionate about cybersecurity, particularly in penetration testing and ethical hacking, and I'm continuously expanding my expertise in areas like vulnerability management and incident response. I am currently focused on expanding my expertise in vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response as I work toward becoming a **Tier 1 Cybersecurity Analyst**.

### For me, _cybersecurity isn’t just a job—it’s a chance to protect the future, make a meaningful impact, and contribute to a safer, more resilient digital world._
