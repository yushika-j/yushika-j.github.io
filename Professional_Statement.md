## Professional Statement

### ***"In cybersecurity, strategy isn't just reactive; it's proactive. You defend best by thinking ahead of your adversaries."***


As an aspiring cybersecurity professional, I am committed to continuous learning, growth, and adaptation in a field that is constantly evolving. My eagerness to acquire new skills and knowledge ensures that I stay ahead of the curve amidst the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity threats and updates. I bring strong communication abilities, exceptional teamwork and leadership skills, and a high degree of independence and intellectual capacity. My problem-solving acumen, creativity, and sociability allow me to adapt quickly to any situation, managing and leading effectively while maintaining composure under pressure.

In addition to my years, I am also certified in Vulnerability Management, Detection, and Response (VMDR), CyberSecurity Asset Management (CSAM), and Vulnerability Management Scanning (VMS). I am currently enrolled in the Google CyberSecurity Certified Professional course, and I plan on obtaining my CompTIA Security+ certification shortly afterward. These credentials reflect my dedication to understanding and addressing the complexities of cybersecurity threats.

My core values of integrity, accountability, authenticity, and hard work are the foundation of my professional ethos. I am determined and highly focused, especially when driven by a passion for my work. These values, combined with my strengths, empower me to support the security goals of various organizations by fostering a culture of continuous learning, proactive problem-solving, and collaborative innovation.

I am particularly drawn to cybersecurity because of its dynamic and challenging environment, where there is always something new to learn and numerous opportunities to make a significant impact. My ultimate goal is to obtain a government security clearance and contribute to national cybersecurity efforts, ensuring the protection of critical information and systems.

I am confident that my unique blend of skills, values, and enthusiasm for cybersecurity will be an asset to any organization seeking to enhance their security posture and stay ahead of emerging threats. As I continue to accumulate certificates, tenure, and technical/practical experience, I am excited to contribute to and grow within the cybersecurity community.
